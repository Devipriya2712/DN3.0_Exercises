DSA essential in Handling Inventories
Performance and Scalability:
•	Time Complexity: As the size of the inventory grows, the operations on the data (such as searching, updating, and deleting) must remain efficient. Efficient algorithms ensure that these operations complete in a reasonable time frame, even with large datasets.
•	Space Complexity: Efficient data structures also manage memory usage effectively. This is crucial for large inventories to avoid excessive memory consumption and ensure that the system can handle large volumes of data.
Data Access and Manipulation:
•	Speed of Access: Quick access to inventory items based on attributes (like product ID) is essential for fast operations. Data structures that support efficient lookups and updates are vital for maintaining operational efficiency.
•	Concurrency and Synchronization: In real-world applications, multiple users may interact with the inventory simultaneously. Data structures and algorithms must be designed to handle concurrent access and ensure data consistency.
Optimization:
•	Search Efficiency: Efficient algorithms and data structures optimize search operations, reducing the time required to locate specific inventory items.
•	Update and Deletion Efficiency: As inventory data changes frequently, efficient algorithms help manage updates and deletions without performance degradation.
Scalability: Properly chosen data structures ensure that the system can handle increasing amounts of data gracefully, allowing for scaling both vertically (more powerful hardware) and horizontally (more distributed systems).
SUITABLE DSA FOR THIS PROBLEM
HashMap (or HashTable):
•	Description: A HashMap stores key-value pairs and provides average O(1)O(1)O(1) time complexity  get, put, and remove operations.
•	Advantages:
o	Fast access, insertion, and deletion.
o	Ideal for scenarios where quick lookups by key (e.g., product ID) are necessary.
•	Disadvantages:
o	Memory overhead due to hash table implementation.
o	Performance can degrade if there are many hash collisions.

TIME COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS  
Add Operation: The ‘addProduct; method has a time complexity of O(1)O(1)O(1) on average. This is because adding an element to a ‘HashMap’ involves computing the hash code of the key and inserting the value into the appropriate bucket.
Update Operation: The ‘updateProduct’ method also has a time complexity of O(1)O(1)O(1) on average. The ‘HashMap’ lookup operation to check if the product exists and the update operation both take constant time.
Delete Operation: The ‘deleteProduct’ method has a time complexity of O(1)O(1)O(1) on average. Removing an element from a ‘HashMap’ involves finding the element using the key and then removing it from the bucket.

OPTIMIZING OPERATION
Capacity and Load Factor: Initialize the ‘HashMap’ with an appropriate initial capacity and load factor to minimize rehashing. This reduces the overhead associated with growing the map dynamically.
Collision Handling: Ensure that your hash function for the product IDs minimizes collisions. Poor hash functions can degrade performance to O(n)O(n)O(n) in the worst case, but with a good hash function, this is unlikely.
Memory Usage: Be mindful of the memory usage as ‘HashMap’ maintains extra overhead for managing the buckets and entries. If memory usage becomes a concern, consider using a more memory-efficient data structure if appropriate for your use case.
‘HashMap’ provides efficient performance for adding, updating, and deleting products from inventory. The time complexity for these operations is O(1)O(1)O(1) on average, and you can optimize performance by configuring the ‘HashMap’ parameters appropriately and using a good hash function.
